# Lab 1: Validation of User Input

## Part 1: BookInfo

Follow along with the instructor to add validation to his BookInfo example web app. 

Report what you did for this exercise by entering the appropriate words in the online text of your submission:

- "Ran it", means you downloaded and successfully ran the completed code.
- "Studied and ran it", means you successfully ran the completed code, but put in breakpoints and examined what was happening at all the critical points in the code.
- "Refactored and ran it", means you added the new code shown by the instructor, got it to work successfully, and studied it.

## Part 2: Community Information Site and Fan Site

Add validation using data annotations to your models. Use validation that makes sense for the properties you choose to validate.

-   Add validation to at least six properties from any of your models.
-   Use at least three different validation annotations.
-   At least one property should have more than one validation annotation.
-   Write a document titled *lab1-validation.md*, or .txt that lists the model properties you validated and the controller methods where you did server-side validation. Put this in a folder named *docs* in the top level of your project folder.
