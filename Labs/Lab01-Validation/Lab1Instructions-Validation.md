# Lab 1: Validation of User Input

## Part 1: BookInfo

Follow along with the instructor to add validation to his BookInfo example web app. 

Report what you did for this exercise by entering the appropriate words in the online text of your submission:

- "Ran it", means you downloaded and successfully ran the completed code.
- "Studied and ran it", means you successfully ran the completed code, but put in breakpoints and examined what was happening at all the critical points in the code.
- "Refactored and ran it", means you added the new code shown by the instructor and got it to work successfully.

## Part 2: Community Information Site and Fan Site

Add validation using data annotations to your models. Use validation that makes sense for the properties you choose to validate.

-   Add validation to at least six properties from any of your models.
-   Use at least three different validation annotations.
-   At least one property should have more than one validation annotation.
-   Write a Validation.md, or .txt, document that lists the model properties you validated and the controller methods where you did server-side validation. Put this in a Docs folder in the top level of your project.



## Submission to Moodle

Upload the following to Moodle:

1.  In the "online text", enter:
    - Report of what you did in part 1.
    - A link to your GitHub repository for part 2.
2.  A code review of your own work.
