## Introduction

- Announcements

- This week, we will cover the "left over" topic from fall term, input validation.

------



### Review

#### C# Attributes

- Programming Guide: [C# Attributes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/attributes/)

- Attributes are a means of associating metadata with code

  - Metadata is additional information about types defined in your program (and remember that classes are types).

  - Attributes are declarative.

  - Attributes can be applied to assemblies (think DLLs), classes, methods, and properties.

## Validation 

- Validation is expected in the browser for good UX (user experience), and required on the server for security.
- Good UX design means users are provided with an easy way to fix input errors.
- In ASP.NET Core MVC, validation is done on the models.
- Validation is implemented using C# attributes. In .NET Core, attributes that are used on model properties are called *data annotations*.

#### Data Annotations

- API Reference: [System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations Namespace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.dataannotations?view=netcore-2.0)

  - Most of these attributes are for validation.
  
  

### Validation Using Data Annotations

- Validation is specified on the  model properties and is then enforced in multiple places:

  - In the database.

  - In HTML form elements in the browser using jQuery validate.

  - In HTTP Requests processed on the server (in case JavaScript is disabled in the browser).

    - Add a break-point to a request method to test this.
- Test this again after [disabling JavaScript](https://www.wikihow.com/Disable-JavaScript).
  
- Validation Example:
  
  ```C#
  [StringLength(60, MinimumLength = 3)]
  [Required]
  public string Title { get; set; }
  ```
  
- Common validation annotations:

  - `[EmailAddress]` validates that a string property is formatted as an email address.
  
    ```c#
    [EmailAddress]
    public string Email { get; set; }
    ```
  
  - `[Range]` validates that a property value is within a specified range.
  
    ```C#
    [Range(1, 10)]
    public int Rating { get; set; }
    ```
  
  - `[RegularExpression]` validates that a string matches a specified [regular expression](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expressions).
  
    ```c#
    [RegularExpression(@"^(([A-za-z]+[\s]{1}[A-za-z]+)|([A-Za-z]+))$")]
    public string UserName {get, set;}
    ```
  
    This regular expression checks for the following criteria:
  
    - UserName can contain the first and last name with a single space. 
    - The last name is optional. If the last name is not present, then there shouldnâ€™t be any space after the first name.
    3. Only upper and lower case alphabets are allowed.
    3. This example is from [Dot Net Tutorials, Regular Expression Attribute in ASP.NET MVC](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/regular-expression-attribute-mvc/)
  
  - `[Required]` validates that the property is not null.
  
    ```C#
    [Required]
    public string Name { get; set; }
    ```
  
    
  
  - `[StringLength]`validates that a string property value doesn't exceed a specified length limit.
  
    ```C#
    [StringLength(1000, MinimumLength = 10)]
    public string ReviewText { get; set; }
    ```
  
    
  
  For a complete list see:  [System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations Namespace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.dataannotations?view=netcore-2.1)




### Validation in the Controller

There are several ways you can perform validation in controller methods:

- Explicit Validation: You add the validation code to a controller method yourself

  - Example: 

    ```C#
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(appt.ClientName)) {
      ModelState.AddModelError(nameof(appt.ClientName),
      "Please enter your name");
    }
    ```

  - Model State Dictionary properties and methods:
    - `AddModelError(property, message)`
    
      This method is used to record a model validation error for the specified property.
    - `GetValidationState(property)`
      
      This method is used to determine whether there are model validation errors for a specific property, expressed as a value from the `ModelValidationState` enumeration:
      
      - *Unvalidated* 
      
        This value means that no validation has been performed on the model property, usually because there was no value in the request that corresponded to the property name.
        
      - *Valid* 
        
          This value means that the request value associated with the property is valid.
      
      - *Invalid* 
      
        This value means that the request value associated with the property is invalid and should not be used.
      - *Skipped* 
      
        This value means that the model property has not been processed, which usually means that there have been so many validation errors that there is no point continuing to perform validation checks.
    - `IsValid`
    
      This property returns true if all the model properties are valid and returns false otherwise.

- Make decisions based on model validation. 
  
  Example:
  
  ```C#
  if (ModelState.IsValid) {
     repo.AddBook(book);
  }
  ```
  
  

### Displaying Validation Errors in the View

- A strongly typed view and model-binding using asp-for tag helpers are required.

- Special Microsoft jQuery functions must be included in the view:
  
```html
<script src= "https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-2.2.0.min.js"></script>

<script src= "https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.validate/1.16.0/jquery.validate.min.js"></script>

<script src= "https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.validation.unobtrusive/3.2.6/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.min.js"></script>
```

- Tag Helpers that display validation errors

  - Summary
    
  ```html
    <div asp-validation-summary="ModelOnly"></div>
  ```
  
  - Individual field
    
    ```html
    <label asp-for="ClientName">Your name:</label>
    <div><span asp-validation-for="ClientName"></span></div>
    <input asp-for="ClientName" />
    ```

## Notes

#### Nullable and non-nullable model properties

- All non-nullable model properties are considered *required* by default.
  - In C#, value types (like int, float, bool) are non-nullable by default. Reference types (like string and other classes) are nullable by default.
- You can make properties nullable by adding ? to the type&mdash;this will also make them nullable in the database and also not required for validation.

#### Validation annotations can change the database schema

Some validation annotations  will cause Entity Framework to change the database schema. Here is a partial list:

- Required
- StringLength

You will need to add a migration and update the database after adding validation annotations that change the database schema.

`dotnet ef migrations add NewMigrationName`

`dotnet ef database update`
