These .NET console apps demonstrates the use lambda expressions

There are two projects in the solution:
* BasicLambda - Shows you how to:
  ** Define a named method using lambda syntax
  ** Pass a method as an argument to another method
  ** Define an anonymous method using lambda syntax
  ** Define a read-only property using lambda syntax
* FunmcAsMethodParam - Demonstrates defining a somewhat more complex anonymous method using lambda syntax and passing it as an argument to a method.

Note: This app is just one app in the CS296nCourseMaterials repository.
To get the source code for this app you will need to clone or download the entire repository.

This demo was written for CS296N, Web Development 2:ASP.NET, at Lane Community College.
